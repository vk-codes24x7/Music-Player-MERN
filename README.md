## Libraries Used

### Axios
- A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the Shazam Core API. It's utilized for fetching song details, searching for tracks, and managing user interactions with the backend.

### React
- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is the backbone of our frontend, enabling the creation of our dynamic and responsive components.

### React-DOM
- Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable efficient management of DOM elements.

### React-Icons
- Offers an extensive collection of icons from various icon libraries. We use React-Icons to enhance the aesthetic appeal and user navigation experience within our app.

### React-Redux
- A library for managing and centralizing application state. React-Redux is used for storing the state of the music player, playlists, and user preferences across the app.

### React-Router-Dom
- Keeps the UI in sync with the URL. It's used for routing in our single-page application, enabling navigation without refreshing the page.

### Swiper
- A modern touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions. Swiper is used for creating a smooth, mobile-friendly carousel for featured playlists and tracks.

### PostCSS
- A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript, enabling features like variables and mixins. It's used in conjunction with TailwindCSS for efficient styling.

### TailwindCSS
- A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without having to leave your HTML. TailwindCSS is key to our app's responsive and customizable design.

### @Reduxjs/Toolkit
- The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies store setup, reduces boilerplate code, and integrates seamlessly with our React-Redux setup.
